# Yahoo Stocks Analysis (2019-2024)

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Yahoo Stocks over the past 5 years, focusing on key indicators and market trends. The analysis leverages moving averages, correlation metrics, and historical market events to provide insights into stock movements.

### Key Insights
###### Moving Averages as Indicators

The 50-day moving average (DMA) and 200-day moving average (DMA) are reliable indicators of stock movement.
Bullish Trend: When the closing price is above both the 50 and 200 DMA, the stock is typically in an uptrend.
Bearish Trend: Conversely, if the closing price is below these DMAs, the stock is usually on a downtrend.
Trend Reversal Points: Points where the 50 and 200 DMAs intersect often signal market trend reversals (e.g., high to low or low to high).
COVID-19 Impact
The significant dip in March 2020 is a clear indicator of the COVID-19 market crash, a historical downturn impacting global markets.
Correlation and Collinearity

The closing price has a very high correlation with most variables except for the volume.
There is strong multicollinearity among variables, suggesting interdependencies.
Modeling Insights

While achieving a good RÂ² score and coefficients is positive, the high correlation (~1) among variables indicates potential pitfalls.
It's essential to be cautious when fitting models based on these highly correlated parameters in real-life scenarios.
